# predicting_stress_in_english_words
This is an assignment of comp9318 to predict the location of the primary stress in English words,
based on given syllables using LR and n-grams.
I received full marks but the accuracy was only around 80% with a macro-f1 at ~0.77, if I remember correctly, and some others could achieve higher.
